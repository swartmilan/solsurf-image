# solsurf-image
Reflectance (and other) analysis of solar reflector surfaces using RAW format images. Makes use of numpy, rawpy and pandas.

Run calibration versions of scripts and notebooks first on a clibration dataset to create a reference for further analysis.

Then, go on to using the default MASTER file for the rest of the collected data until another calibration is deemed necessary.
